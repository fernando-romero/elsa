A new Amsterdam-based team has decided to address a problem #1 all developers in the world have: keeping CV up-to-date.

As a startup with lean mentality they decided to start small and in the first version support retrieving relevant
information from GitHub and displaying it in the terminal.

The program should take the following inputs:

OAuth token (from GITHUB_OAUTH_TOKEN environment variable);
Username, as a command line argument.
When started, the program should output all public repositories of the user, and for each repositoryâ€”list collaborator
ordered by the number of commits per collaborator in descending order. Use GitHub REST API.

Choose any language you prefer. Treat the code as if it goes straight into production.



* Read GITHUB_OAUTH_TOKEN using lightbend config.
* Enter username as cmd line arg.
* Connect to Github API.
